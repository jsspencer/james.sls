James' salt configuration
=========================

Just some setup for laptops and servers running Arch Linux (ARM Archlinux on raspberry pi) using salt in masterless mode.

Setup
-----

* install salt-zmq (or salt-raet, if you wish)
* install cower for downloading AUR packages
* set ``file_client: local`` in ``/etc/salt/minion`` and, if not cloned to ``/src/salt``, set ``file_roots`` to the appropriate directory.
* run salt-call --local state.highstate as root/using sudo.

Layout

top.sls
   top state - sets which states are included on a given machine.
basic.sls
    Common packages and setting.
dev.sls
    Development-specific packages.
laptop.sls
    Packages and settings specific to laptops/interactive machines.
server.sls
    Packages and settings specific to server (currently just a raspberry pi).
